Henry Kautz <kautz@cs.rochester.edu>

Compilation

- Edit flags at beginning of walksat.c to change the following
options:

    Exactly one of the following should be defined to be 1, 
    the rest defined to be 0:
	UNIX (Most versions of Unix, including Linux and Mac OS X)
        NT   (Microsoft Windows)
        ANSI (Ansi Unix, use only if will not compile under Unix)

    Following may be defined at your option:	

	DYNAMIC - use dynamic arrays; static arrays allow more compiler optimizations
        MAXATOM - if static arrays used, must set
        MAXCLAUSE - if static arrays used, must set

- For Windows, create a workspace/project and add the library
Winmm.lib to the "linker" tab.

Compilation options:
	make           # compile everything
	make install   # compile and copy to $USER/bin
	make clean     # remove .o files

Walksat specifications

Walksat attempts to find a satisfying model of a cnf formula.
Format is .cnf format:


c Optional comments at start of file.
c The "p" line specifies cnf format, number vars, number clauses
c Variables are numbered starting at 1
c Each clause ends with 0
p cnf 3 2
1 -3 0
2 3 -1 0

Walksat reads from standard in (or from a file specified as a command
line argument) and writes to standard out (and standard error).  To
get a list of command line options, type
	walksat -help
(or any other illegal option).

*****************************************************************

Also included in distribution:

makewff [-seed N] [-cnf] [-f] [-kf] clen nvars nclauses

Generate random formulas using the fixed clause length model.
The -seed argument can be used to initialize the random number
generator.  The -cnf, -f, and -kf options specify the format of the
wff file; for walksat use -cnf.  Clen is the length of each clause,
nvars the number of variables, and nclauses the number of clauses.

makequeens N

Generate a N-queens formula.
